<h2>What are ARE dates?</h2>

If someone wants to appeal against the decision made by the Home Office or
Tribunal, they must do so before the Appeal Rights Exhausted (ARE) date.
If the person doesnâ€™t appeal before this date, the decision becomes final.

<h2>How are ARE dates calculated?</h2>

ARE dates arise when a set number of days have passed since the most recent
Home Office or Tribunal decision has been made regarding a particular case.

The number of days is determined by the decision type and the stage of the
appeal. A number of exclusion dates are also taken into account.
